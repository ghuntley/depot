========================
NixOS on WSL for newbies 
========================
A minimal root filesystem for running NixOS on WSL. It can be used with
DistroLauncher_ as ``install.tar.gz``.

It is expected that ``/nix/var/nix/profiles/system/activate`` is run during
installation, for example as part of the ``DistributionInfo::CreateUser``
function.


systemd support
===============

WSL comes with its own (non-substitutable) init system while NixOS uses systemd.
Simply starting systemd later on does not work out of the box, because systemd
as system instance refuses to start if it is not PID 1. This unfortunate
combination is resolved in two ways:

* the user's default shell is replaced by a wrapper script that acts is init
  system and then drops to the actual shell
* systemd is started in its own PID namespace; therefore, it is PID 1. The shell
  wrapper (see above) enters the systemd namespace before dropping to the shell.


How to build
============

::

   $ nix-build -A system -A config.system.build.tarball ./nixos.nix

The resulting mini rootfs can then be found under
``./result-2/tarball/nixos-system-x86_64-linux.tar.gz``.


How to deploy
============

Assume

* You put your ``nixos-system-x86_64-linux.tar.gz`` into ``%userprofile%\NixOS``
 
Then

* Open Powershell and execute ``wsl --import NixOS %userprofile%\NixOS nixos-system-x86_64-linux.tar.gz --version 2``
* Start wsl and execute the lines from ``activate.sh``
* Exit and restart wsl
* Now can copy your adaptation of ``configuration.nix`` and the ``hardware-configuration.nix``
  from i.e. the nixos where you built the tarball to ``\\wsl$\NIXOS\etc\nixos`` and
* then execute ``sudo nixos-rebuild switch``
