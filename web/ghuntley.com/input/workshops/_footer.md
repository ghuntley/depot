# remote workshops

As well as workshops run face-to-face in person, remote workshops are now also available. They work great for distributed teams or where the logistics of me attending in person simply don't work out, delivered via the organisation's choice of online conferencing tool.

# price

Price is POA and it can be affected by availability, coordination with existing travel commitments and alignment to the syllabus. Price is always a per-day rate rather than per-head and generally works out less than sending the team to a decent conference. All materials used in the workshop are handed over upon completion and organisations are welcome to repeat the exercises internally.
