title: introduction to the Uno Platform
---

With the Uno Platform you can empower your existing .NET teams to build beautiful, performant, single codebase and cross-platform web, mobile and desktop apps. In this single-day intensive workshop, you are introduced to the development philosophy of Uno and will build a new application from scratch that uses this philosophy. You'll also learn productivity tips and how Uno works under the hood.

# workshop audience and size

Some knowledge of unix-like command lines and some programming experience are required, but no prior knowledge of Nix and NixOS themselves is required. There's always a breadth of competency and experience so I tailor the pace and depth accordingly. Often this means a combination of one-on-one time with some participants whilst setting stretch goals for others. Ultimately, everyone gets the opportunity to be challenged whilst not being overwhelmed.

I try to aim for between 15 and 30 participants in a workshop. This keeps the numbers high enough to get robust group discussion going and low enough to ensure I can provide individual support as required. Whilst I've run with both smaller and larger groups, this is the "sweet spot".
