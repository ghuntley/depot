I often chat to the media about issues relating to open source software, either as a result of research I've been involved in or as an independent voice on topical issues. This ranges from commentary in online pieces, to radio and to national news. Much of the time this is in a very consumer-centric context where I explain technology for the "layman", that is to put technical concepts in language that anyone can consume.

I've worked with many global publications over the years including:

<style>
.media-logos
{
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 20px;
}

.media-logos img
{
  height: 40px !important;
  margin: 15px 25px;
}

.article_text p.media-logos > a
{
  border: none;
}

@media (min-width:0)and (max-width:45em)
{
  .media-logos img
  {
    height: 23px !important;
    margin: 7px 12px;
  }
}
</style>
<p class="media-logos">

I'm happy to contribute to any pieces I can add insight to. Get in touch via the [contact page](/contact) if you'd like further information.
