# abstract

Open-source has always been driven by the community: the majority of open-source software that the world depends on was built by volunteers. Developments in open-source create both unique opportunities and unique challenges for community. If you're looking to increase your involvement in open-source, or are already a leader of an open-source community, come share your ideas, expertise, best practices and questions for likeminded maintainers. This meetup will be led by MVPs and RDs and will cover various topics related to open-source software and community.
