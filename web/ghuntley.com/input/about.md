üôå I‚Äôm Geoff, a principal developer advocate. A software engineer and devops engineer with a "Jack-of-All-Trades" background. People often ask what the heck is a Developer Advocate. Here's one way to explain it...

> "A software developer, a marketer, a branding manager, an integrations manager, a business development partner, a domain expert, a public speaker, an event manager, and a technical writer walk into a bar. He orders a glass of scotch. After all, it‚Äôs been a long day of jet-setting and hand-holding as a developer advocate."

I deeply care about helping developers be successful with platforms or technology products that I deeply care about. As a Developer Advocate my role is to act as a bridge between organizational structures and the developer community.

On an average day (tm) you'll find me shipping features along side the engineering team, crafting code examples, curating communities, doctoring documentation, and acting as an internal advocate and feedback-getter.

Opinions expressed publicly are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my clients unless otherwise stated. Do not quote me as ‚Äú$company person Geoffrey Huntley said‚Äù ‚Äì if I speak for a company, I will publish on its channels. This is my personal slice of the internet. Everything here is me and is my opinion.
