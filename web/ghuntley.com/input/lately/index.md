This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.

# where?

I’m home Country Queensland, Australia. It’s Autumn. I’m observing [the AEST timezone](https://time.is/Sydney).

<!-- 

# upcoming conferences

I'm always happy to speak - just ask.

# previous conferences

Sept 2019 I spent a month at Montréal, Québec where I ran a [workshop on building cross-platform applications with the Uno Platform](/workshops). I was invited but didn't speak at [DDD Adelaide](https://dddadelaide.com/agenda) on the topic of WebAssembly but was unfortunately unable to attend.

# what I'm doing now

- Porting a linux distribution to windows subsystem for linux (nixos)

# what is on my backlog

- WebAssembly, WebAssembly, WebAssembly
- Learning more about knitting and haskell when time permits

# what I'm considering doing

- Sketching up how we could automate closed captions for twitch broadcasters. It's annoying that a segment of society is being excluded by default.
