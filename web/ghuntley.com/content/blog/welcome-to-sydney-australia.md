Hello there! First, you have made the correct decision to visit Sydney, it's a pretty chill place. To help you fall even more in love with my city, I have provided you with a list of awesome things to do. If you discover something awesome during your stay please send in a PR with the deets by tapping the Octocat.

# coffee

Australia has some of the best coffee in the world, that is if you know where to find it. If you're on the run and can't venture to a specific cafe, then choose any place that serves [pablo and rustys](https://pabloandrustys.com.au) or [campos coffee](https://camposcoffee.com/). Avoid any establishment that serves "[grinders coffee](https://www.ccamatil.com/en/our-businesses-and-brands/our-businesses/alcohol-and-coffee)" as that coffee is terrible and the food could be questionable.

Most folks drink warm milk aka the flat white; when buying for another Aussie, it's typically [the safe default](https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/flat-and-fabulous-20120218-1tfdk.html).

I'm pretty particular when it comes to coffee, as when brewed with high-quality beans and by an on-point barrister, coffee is a tasting experience similar to scotch or wine.

Make sure you drop on by [espressory](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/espressory/@-33.8658781,151.1377908,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b12ae40531a39bf:0xec915a32e0a6e994!2m2!1d151.2078309!2d-33.8658979), ask for Sam or Peter to brew you something special by hand - either a V60 (ie no milk) or an espresso using beans from their friends and family collection that are sourced from micro-roasters around Australia. 

If you are willing to trek then I recommend also grabbing a cup at [SingleO](http://singleo.com.au/). 

# beer

If you are in the CBD and want to optimise on beer quality, in order of my preference, look no further than:

* https://thenoblehops.com/
* https://www.therocks.com/eat-drink/harts-pub/
* https://www.redoak.com.au/
* https://beerdeluxe.com.au/

If you are looking for a place on the weekend and are up for a quick detour out of the city, then [Batch Brewing](http://www.batchbrewingco.com.au/) offers an excellent hipster brewery experience.

# bars

There's a rooftop bar on top of the [Glenmore](http://theglenmore.com.au/) with spectacular views of the harbor, their beer selection is generic but it's a great place to meet people. 

* For a more traditional pub and grub experience with great beer head on over to [Harts](https://www.therocks.com/eat-drink/harts-pub/).
* For scotch nothing beats [The Baxsters Inn](http://thebaxterinn.com/). 
* For an arcade/starwars cantina experience head on over to [I <3 Goats](https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/the-sg-sydney).
* For eSports teleport to [Spawn Point](https://www.spawnpoint.com.au/).

If it's late and everything is closed in the city or you are after a pizza dive bar, pinball and live music experience head on over to [Frankies](http://www.frankiespizzabytheslice.com/).

# food

Definitely grab a steak sandwich at [The Grounds of Alexandria](https://thegroundscity.com.au/), korean bbq chicken at [Naruone](https://grabyourfork.blogspot.com/2012/12/naruone-sydney.html) and a beef laska from [malaychinese](http://www.malaychinese.com.au/menu/). 

For an all-in-one champange, chicken, rap and sneakers experience head on over to [Buttered](https://buttersydney.com.au/). If a ten-course tasting menu is your thing then you'll feel right at home at [Quay](https://www.quay.com.au/) or [Rockpool](http://www.rockpoolbarandgrill.com.au/).

Had too much beer and feel under the weather? Head on over to [Harry's Cafe de Wheels](http://www.harryscafedewheels.com.au/) and order a curry tiger pie with peas and mash.
