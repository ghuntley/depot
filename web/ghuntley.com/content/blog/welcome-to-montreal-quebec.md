Hello there! To help you fall even more in love with one of my favourite cities here's a list of ideas. If you discover something awesome during your stay please send in a GitHub pull-request with the deets by tapping the Octocat.

## wifi

There is city wide WiFi mesh network that's super fast. You probably won't need a mobile phone data service if you are traveling from afar...

## coffee

- [Paquebot Vieux-Mtl](https://goo.gl/maps/PwWY1B67YZGF8aoAA) for 3rd wave coffee. Great french hipster vibes. If you want to knock out some writing or just chill this place is grand.
- [Oh My Deer Café](https://goo.gl/maps/wt75aau2hqFQqVuV8) does _amazing_ espressos. Nearby Schwuatz Deli.
- [Le Petit Dep](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qJct1mt78cDbKhTs9) does a perfect Aussie flat white. Great anglo vibes. Doubles as a tourist gift shop.
