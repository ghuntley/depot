Closing stale issues may seem inhospitable or offensive but the alternative is to disrespect you by setting false expectations and implicitly ignoring work. This is open-source software, created and maintained as an unpaid hobby. Automatically closing issues makes it explicit: if work is not progressing, then it's stale and should be closed because it may be already resolved.

We need more folks helping out with maintenance, not just contribution.


making it clear that something can’t/won’t ever be worked on is also being real with users when it’s literally you working on it
