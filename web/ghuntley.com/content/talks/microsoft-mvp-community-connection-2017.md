# Abstract

Something has changed in open-source the last few years. Today, more people use
open source than ever before, but fewer people contribute back than ever
before. Everybody assumes that somebody else is doing it. This is also known as
the “free rider problem” and left unchecked, this it leads to a tragedy of the
commons. Open-source software is digital infrastructure which is maintained by
people who do so for the love of it and mastery of their craft. Just like
physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure needs regular upkeep by
maintainers. Unfortunatley these maintainers are now regular receipients of
abuse and receive demands for unpaid work by employees of publically listed
companies, governments, major software companies and startups. Despite building
their success on this digital infrastructure, much of the leadership in these
industries are unaware of these issues, and no individual company or
organisation is incentivised to address the public good problem alone. We, the
maintainers of open-source software, want to help you, all of you, but have you
ever thought about how you can help us?
