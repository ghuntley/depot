# abstract

Speaker: Geoffrey Huntley (Microsoft MVP)

Tune in for a session with Geoff to learn about reactive programming that you can use with your next WPF or WinForms project. Reactive is a paradigm that allows you to express the idea around a feature in one readable place, abstract mutable state away from your user interfaces and improve the testability of your application.
