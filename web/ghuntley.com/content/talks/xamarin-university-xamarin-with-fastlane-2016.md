# Abstract
Apple doesn't provide any way to interact with their App Store programmatically, and Google doesn't provide a command line interface, which means releasing software can be a pain, releases don't happen as often as it should, and something frequently goes wrong because humans are involved. 

In this lecture, we find a solution to this very problem and other everyday tedious tasks, such as developer certificate provisioning and code signing by using the popular http://Fastlane.tools  framework.

If you're not using Fastlane, then you are stealing clients time and wasting precious brain cycles. In the last 14 months, _3.8 million_ developer hours have been saved by those who have seen the light.
