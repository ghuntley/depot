My name is Geoffrey Huntley, and this is my personal website.

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

I do not share your data with any third parties.

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so he can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
