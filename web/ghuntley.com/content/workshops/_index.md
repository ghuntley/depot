Geoff has authored and delivered workshops at community events, large technical conferences and online lectures. He's always thrilled to share his knowledge at conferences or user group meetings, or appear on podcasts and can speak to a variety of audiences from non-technical to deeply technical. He has no further workshops planned for 2019 but hey, Geoff's always happy to speak - just ask.
