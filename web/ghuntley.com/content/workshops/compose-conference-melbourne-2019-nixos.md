# background

[Compose is a conference](http://www.composeconference.org/2019-melbourne/speakers/#unconference) for functional programmers, focused on technologies such as Haskell, Scala, Clojure, OCaml, F#, SML and others.

Functional programming has been taken up widely, by industry and hobbyists alike. For many of us it has renewed our belief that code should be beautiful, and that programming can be as enjoyable as it is practical. Compose is about bringing together functional programmers of all levels of skill and experience — from technical leads to novices, and from long-time hackers to students just getting started.

Our experiences have shown that the theoretical can be put into practice with great success, and that topics once considered “advanced” can be made understandable and spread widely. For example, type systems, often considered complex, can simplify our lives by teaching compilers to do some of our reasoning for us.

Compose Conference has been running in New York since 2015.

C◦mp◦se :: Melbourne brings this experience to Melbourne in partnership with the Melbourne Functional Programming Association Inc.

# abstract

The Nix/NixOS ecosystem is a new way of building software.

Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes package management reliable and reproducible. It provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple versions of a package, multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments.

NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and configuration management. Built on top of the Nix package manager, it is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has many other advantages.

This workshop introduces attendees to using, developing on, and developing for Nix and Nixos.

Some knowledge of unix-like command lines and some programming experience are required, but we'll assume no prior knowledge of Nix and NixOS themselves.

Please bring your laptop with a recent copy of VirtualBox installed on it.
