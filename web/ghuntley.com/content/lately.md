# where?

I’m home Country Queensland, Australia. It’s Autumn. I’m observing [the AEST timezone](https://time.is/Sydney).

# upcoming conferences

I'm always happy to speak - just ask.

# previous conferences

Sept 2019 I spent a month at Montréal, Québec where I ran a [workshop on building cross-platform applications with the Uno Platform](/workshops). I was invited but didn't speak at [DDD Adelaide](https://dddadelaide.com/agenda) on the topic of WebAssembly due to personal circumtances. Most people think WebAssembly is only for the Web. Yes, WebAssembly has huge implications for the web, but also to your career as developer — it provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web, as client-side and server-side applications at near native speed. 


# what I'm doing now

- Helping provide facts about covidsafe. Growing and supporting an independant community of researchers. Working with the media move the narrative forward to resolving marketing and adoption issues. Championing the establishment of a bugbounty program.


# what is on my backlog

- Taking some personal time away from software
- WebAssembly, WebAssembly, WebAssembly
- Porting a linux distribution to windows subsystem for linux (nixos)
- Learning more about knitting and haskell when time permits

# what I'm considering doing

- Sketching up how we could automate closed captions for twitch broadcasters. It's annoying that a segment of society is being excluded by default.
