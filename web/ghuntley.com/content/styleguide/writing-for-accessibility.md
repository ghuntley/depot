* Create a hierarchy, with the most important information first.
* Place similar topics in the same paragraph, and clearly separate different topics with headings.
* Use plain language. Write short sentences and familiar words.
* Links should provide information on the associated action or destination. Avoid saying "click here" or "learn more."
* Avoid using images when descriptive text will do.
* Avoid directional instructions or language that requires the reader to see the layout or design of the page.
* Label inputs on forms with clear names and use appropriate tags. Think carefully about what fields are necessary, and especially which ones you mark as required.
