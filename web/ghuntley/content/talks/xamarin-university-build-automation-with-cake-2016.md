# Abstract
Join Geoffrey Huntley for an introduction to Cake-build and an in-depth walk-through of what you've got to know when compiling Xamarin applications and implementing a build pipeline for a library that targets nine different platforms.

Xamarin University attendees will walk away with a template for building applications (or libraries) and the knowledge to be able to implement them within your current project. This lecture won't be a death by powerpoint, please come with meaty questions and ask them during the guest lecture; rather than at the end.
