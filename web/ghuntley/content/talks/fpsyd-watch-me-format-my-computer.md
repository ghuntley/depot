# abstract

Come heckle me whilst I install Linux on my computer live on stage. You'll learn all about the functional declarative operating system called NixOS and leave questioning why your team and the industry went all in with Docker.

If /usr/bin and /bin didn't exist what potential could that unlock? What if ansible, chef and puppet were built into the operating system but better? What if you didn't need to use sudo because you can side-by-side install everything? What if it was /impossible/ to permanently break your operating system?

ðŸ†’

NixOS is one of the most popular opensource projects on GitHub but you've probably never heard of it. No experience with Linux or operating systems is required. I really will be formatting my computer in this session for your entertainment and to teach you what I wish I had of known when i first discovered Nix.
