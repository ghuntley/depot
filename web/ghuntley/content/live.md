üôå I‚Äôm Geoff, an open source software engineer. I‚Äôm currently in Sydney, Australia. I‚Äôm observing [the AEST timezone](https://time.is/Sydney). Instead of writing and maintaining software on my own I'm inviting you to pair-program with me in my office. Let's build software together. Be interactive, I love live suggestions, but please be kind and constructive. Live streaming can be scary. üíñ

Opinions expressed publicly are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my clients unless otherwise stated. Do not quote me as ‚Äú$company person Geoffrey Huntley said‚Äù ‚Äì if I speak for a company, I will publish on its channels. This is my personal slice of the internet. Everything here is me and is my opinion.

# schedule

The stream schedule is maintained in [an online calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2h1bnRsZXkuY29tX3BjNWo0MjdjZG1sNW81MmVqczE2aG91YmMwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20). Past stream recordings are on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/geoffreyhuntley). When I'm not broadcasting you'll find me in the [discord](https://ghuntley.com/chat) chat. Please drop in and say howdy.

# contributing

There's a [contributing guide](https://github.com/ghuntley/live/CONTRIBUTING.md) that outlines how you can get involved. Let's build software together. Be interactive, I love live suggestions, but please be kind and constructive. Live streaming can be scary. üíñ 

# support me

Please follow me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/geoffreyhuntley) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhuntley). Tell your friends, as by doing so you'll help prove that there is demand for live coding on twitch and this activity worth doing. Twitch subs and bits are also greatly appreciated.

If you truly appreciate the work do on-air or in open source, please [buy me a cup coffee](https://www.patreon.com/ghuntley).  Things that take mental energy just work better with coffee!  I (almost always) brew my own coffee unless I'm in the city in which case you'll usually find me hanging out at [Espressory](https://www.espressory.com.au/). 

Anyway, thanks for any support you can offer if you decide to.

# operational safety

The 20th of December will go down as an iconic day in history. Robert E. Kelly, a political science professor at Pusan National University in South Korea, was explaining the ramifications of the impeachment of South Korea President Park Geun-hye live on the BBC in March when his two young children made their on-air debut. The clip quickly went viral and Kelly and his wife Kim Jung-A were soon [the focus of media around the world](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/12/20/bbc-dad-robert-kelly-thought-his-career-over-after-kids-hilariously-interrupted-live-interview/968226001/). 

{{< twitter 840172946211627009 >}}

Kelly told the Guardian that he wasn't prepared for the spotlight the viral clip cast on his family. He said his daughter's elementary school had to hire a guard to ensure no "weirdos" showed up, and he felt uncomfortable with many peoples' assumption that his wife was his nanny. 

> "People were reading stuff into our relationship and, oh my God, I didn‚Äôt want to get near any of that crap, so we didn‚Äôt say anything", he told the Guardian. "It was a comedy of errors, a family blooper. There was nothing to say."

Whilst I live a somewhat public life, to ensure this doesn't happen I've implemented safeguards to minimise the risks of broadcasting on the internet. 

The line of defense is [a strip of lights](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Ambiance-LightStrip-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B0167H33DU) attached to my door frame that act as a traffic light to let folks know if a broadcast or video call/meeting is in progress. This simple system is extremely handy for communicating availability. 

<!-- tweet 895518510025256960 -->

If you work remotely from your house as I do you should totally steal this idea - [I did](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/IsDaddyOnACallABusyLightPresenceIndicatorForLyncForMyHomeOffice.aspx). When I jump on a call or I am broadcasting the light automatically changes to red and my children understand what it means as I've had the system in place for a couple years now.

"Hot" microphones are a recipe for disaster so none of my microphones are on unless I physically activate them

<!-- tweet 1020620842428846080 -->

I use a dedicated control panel so that I can switch inputs via dedicated buttons and can fade to black instantly if the need arises. It is so important to have a big fat eject button, bumbling through systrays and application focus to terminate a stream is another recipe for disaster.

# inadvertent disclosure

I have multiple systems in place (multiple-monitors, broadcasting under an isolated operating system account, automated privacy screen switcher software, a physical production controlpad) to reduce the likely hood of accidentally disclosing secrets whilst on the air. That doesn't mean it cannot happen. 

If you believe there has been inadvertent disclosure please get in [contact with me](mailto:ghuntley@ghuntley.com) immediately. I don't have the resources of [Google](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat) or [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/) but at minimum if you so desire, I'll put your name in the end of show hall of fame credits and send you some swag in the mail. Thank-you.
