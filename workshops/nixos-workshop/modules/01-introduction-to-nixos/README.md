# Introduction to NixOS

## üìñ Overview

This workshop provides a walk through of installing, configuring and
administrating the GNU/Linux operating system NixOS. Each module contains some
background information on major features and concepts in NixOS, and includes
activities to apply what you have learned.

By the end of this module you will:

* Learn what NixOS is and understand how NixOS has solved fundamental problems
  which plague other operating systems.
* Discover that NixOS does not use the standard directory structure found in
  other Linux distributions.
* Discover that industry configuration management tools are no longer required.
* Discover that `sudo` to install software is no longer required.

## üí° What is NixOS

How many times have you had a broken operating system because you upgraded a
software that other components depended on? How many late night stays have you
had because you had to make an application work, because the new package that
you installed broke it? How many times, when in frustration, you gave up
repairing your operating system and just decided to re-install your operating
system from scratch? Restoring data files are easy; restoring system
configuration from the last working state, however, is a one-way ticket to hell.

Ideas that change the way we do computing come rarely. A lot of the technology
that we are using now are just re-hashes of old ones, layers upon layers of
cosmetics enveloping old concepts. Entire product lines are based upon this lack
of creativity and ingenuity. Old problems are not solved. Instead, these
so-called innovative solutions merely pass around the problem while painting it
with new shades, claiming that at least, they made it more colorful.

NixOS is a GNU/Linux distribution that solves these problems by leveraging on
the determinism of the [Nix package manager][nix-workshop] and by using a single
declarative configuration file that contains all settings and knobs in one place
‚Äî [/etc/nixos/configuration.nix][nixos-generate-default-config]. This file
contains information about your file-systems, users, services, network
configuration, input devices, kernel parameters, and more. You can take
someone's configuration.nix and recreate their exact operating system
configuration state!

In NixOS you don‚Äôt have to fiddle around with the whole system manually to
obtain the configuration that you want. You don‚Äôt have to use ad-hoc solutions
to specify a desired configuration state. You don‚Äôt need to install additional
software to manage system configuration.

NixOS has atomic upgrades and rollbacks. It‚Äôs always safe to try an upgrade or
configuration change: if things go wrong, you can always roll back to the
previous configuration. Declarative specs and safe upgrades make NixOS a great
system for DevOps use.

One of the primary differences you'll notice in NixOS when comparing it other
GNU/Linux distributions is that NixOS does not follow the [Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard][fhs-standard]. NixOS does not have `/usr/` and `/opt/`. NixOS does
have `/bin/` and `/usr/bin/`, which contains only `sh` and `env`, respectively ‚Äî
both of which are actually symlinks to the real programs somewhere in
`/nix/store/`.

The top-level location for system binaries ‚Äî the ones installed explicitly by
the administrator are located in `/run/current-system/sw/bin/` and
`/run/current-system/sw/sbin/`.

User-installed programs, on the other hand, are available at their respective
`~/.nix-profile/bin/`. 

These locations cannot be modified through normal means; dedicated programs must
be used to write to these trees.


## üóπ Recap

1. You don‚Äôt need to install additional software to manage system configuration.
   Desired state configuration is built into the operating system, removing the
   need for configuration management tools such as Chef, Puppet or Ansible.
1. Configuration of the operating system is defined in a single declarative
   configuration file at
   [/etc/nixos/configuration.nix][nixos-generate-default-config]
1. NixOS does not follow the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard][fhs-standard]
   standard and `/usr/` or `/opt` does not exist. Instead symbolic links to
   directories under `/nix/store/` are heavily used. More information about how
   this works is provided in a future module.
1. Sudo is not needed to install software. Users can install any program without
   needing sudo privileges. Programs are installed into the users home directory
   at `~/.nix-profile/bin/`.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è What's next

In [the next module][next-module] you'll install NixOS either on a computer as
its primary operating system or in a virtual machine on your computer. Each
module from here onwards you'll learn about NixOS concepts and how to manage
NixOS.
